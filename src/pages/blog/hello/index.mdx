## A quick intro

For those that don't know me personally, I'm finally graduating from the University of Toronto this December with a double major in computer science and statistics. 

It's been a non-linear path, taking me across several different majors, but I finally have some time on my hands where I'm not making slides or paraphrasing reports all day ðŸ¤¡


## The plan for 2023, v1

### Jan - Apr
- Actively not look for work
- Work on <a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200" href="https://trytuuli.com" target="_blank">tuuli</a> instead
- Ship at least 2 <a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200 no-underline" href="/work">personal projects</a> I've been putting off

### May - Jun
- Revisit HK, finally ðŸ’€

### Jul - Sep
- Try not to run out of money
- ???

### Oct - Dec
- Realistically probably look for jobs
