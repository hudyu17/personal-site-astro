## The plan for 2023, v2
Added some new thoughts in *italics*

### Jan - Apr
- ~~Actively not look for work~~ - *I've come to realise that I might be better served with more professional experience, both to better understand the industries I care about (transportation, urban design) and to build my technical skills*
- ⏳ Work on <a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200" href="https://trytuuli.com" target="_blank">tuuli</a> instead - *Still going, made some pitches and won some money*
- ✅ Ship at least 2 <a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200 no-underline" href="/work">personal projects</a> I've been putting off:  *<a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200 no-underline" href="/blog/crossywalk">1. Crossywalk</a> and <a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200 no-underline" href="/blog/matcha">2. CareerMatcha</a>*

### May - Jun
- Revisit HK, finally 💀
- *Visit Japan, Taiwan, and Australia too*

### Jul - Sep
- Try not to run out of money - *Still true, but when is this not true?*
- ??? - *Also never not true*

### Oct - Dec
- ~~Realistically probably look for jobs~~ - *The process is starting now* 😎
