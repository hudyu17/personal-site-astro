## happy new year

Staying true to my <a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200 no-underline" href="/blog/hello">2023 plan</a>, I shipped my first personal project of the year - and a few days ahead of schedule.

<a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200" href="https://crossywalk.com" target="_blank">Crossywalk</a> is a place for everyone to suggest and vote on crosswalks they should exist. That's it ðŸ¤·

Watch my video walkthrough <a class="hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-yellow-200" href="https://youtu.be/5jnd4w65lWs" target="_blank">here!</a>

## why thisÂ¿

Apart from the - hopeful - social good that can come out of this, I was getting tired of crossing Bloor at the Longos (opposite 121) when coming out of the TTC to get to work. 

I bet that everyone else who worked in that building also hated it, so why not give people a place to upvote their displeasure?
